== Spring Boot Marvel Game
Spring Boot Marvel Game is a Java 11+, Spring Boot (version 2.4.4) application accessing the Marvel API’s available at *https://developer.marvel.com[Marvel Developer Portal]*, exposing REST services to fetch all characters, retrieve a character with an Id and play the game.
The idea is only provide a Java code with logics used to access external APIs and provide a functionality as a game and others to retrieve data.

Playing character arena game achieve the following:

. Read in 2 superhero names and a seed value between 1-10.
. Retrieve the "description" of each hero from the "character" endpoint of the api. 
. Search the word in the position of the description corresponding to the seed value. As an example, if the provided seed value were 3, will choose the 3rd word in the description for each character.
. The hero with the most characters in their word at that position is the winner, but if the word is either "gamma" or "radioactive" that character automatically wins.
. Return a Json payload representing the Winner.
